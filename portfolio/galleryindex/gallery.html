<p id="desc1" class="desc">To achieve the tone that best suits Cinemagic's target audience, a color palette that evokes night life was chosen.
   This evokes a sense of excitement for the service, like a night on a town would. Two fonts are also displayed, Orator STD which has a unique
    look perfect for headings, while Gills Sans acts as a more general purpose font. To create a visual identity for Cinemagic, 
   classic film imagery, along with magic elements that play on the company's name will be combined. </p>
<p id="desc2" class="desc">For the logo, the idea was to create a distinctive image that could subtly hint towards all of the aspects of Cinemagic. The online service aspect is indicated by the blue arrow, which implies motion and home while the blue shade emanates dependability. The hat 
plays on the 'magic' aspect of Cinemagic to reinforce the brand, while the film strip puts forth the classic notion of movies. The unique juxtaposition of these elements, alone with distinctive lettering will make the logo immediately recognizable.</p>
<p id="desc3" class="desc">Here is one simple approach for a print ad. The audience's attention is grabbed by exciting movie genres, followed by a tagline that plays on Cinemagic's branding, and also tells of the online nature of the service. The bottom displays the website customers can visit to get started with Cinemagic. The logo is used as a sign off as a visual element that people can make a connection to. While this is a simple copy ad, the copy is placed strategically, to form a kind of pointer that leads the audience's eye down to the company logo and website. </p>
<p id="desc4" class="desc">This visual ad aims at having emotional and functional appeal. The images tell the audience how easy the Cinemagic service is to use and about the great movie night that they could be having. At the same time, the ad aims to have nostalgic appeal. The fuzzy edges of the images, along with the whole ad being framed as if it is on a strip of film imply the idea of a memory. This suggests all of the great memories customers can form by starting with Cinemagic. The logo is again used as a sign-off. </p>
<p id="desc5" class="desc">For this last print ad, copy and visual combine to create a multi-faceted message. The curtain frames the door is meant to hint at the idea of going out for a show, something that your target audience may not get a chance to do as often. This, along with the the copy, let's the audience know that that some of that excitement can come straight to their door. The website address and logo let the audience know how they can get started. </p>
<p id="desc6" class="desc">Here is some possible collateral designs.  An attractive gift card design, such as the one displayed serves as a great way to spread the word, since happy customers can give these as gifts to friends and family. The design uses the distinctive Orator font at the top, along with elements and colors that have a classic movie kind of feel. The envelope that Cinemagic delivers it's DVDs in is important as it is the time customers will most tangibly interact with Cinemagic. The flaps fold out to form a top hat and the black coloring along with the purple band will set this apart from standard white mail. Lastly, here is a design for the e-mail customers receive when their items ship. The design is playful, with DVDs being displayed peeking out of top hats, while brightly color elements invite customers to further use the Cinemagic service.   </p>
<p id="desc7" class="desc">For the homepage, a large image is used along with a large button for signing up for the service. This being front and center will make it easy for customers to sign up, which will be important since much of the rest of the ad campaign aims at getting people to this website. Furthermore, the scrolling bar below the image shows new DVD releases, giving more impetus for people to sign up. The sign in button for existing customers is predictably in the upper right hand corner of the page. The color palette is consistent with other Cinemagic ad material, reinforcing Cinemagic's visual identity.  </p>
<p id="desc8" class="desc">The product page offers a unique way to navigate movies, that differ from competitors such as Netflix. Rather than overwhelming with row after row of scrolling movies, this navigation utilizes a horizontal bar that allows customers to choose a category and then scroll through movies vertically. If there is a specific title, the search bar is easy to find in the upper right of the page. A large hat acts a queue, which displays movies customers have requested, and can be clicked on to manage. Also, in the upper left of the page, customers who have signed in are welcomed, and can manage their accounts from a drop down menu. </p>
    <p id="desc9" class="desc">This last page would be a unique feature for Cinemagic's website.  This offers customers another reason to hang out on Cinemagic's website a little longer by offering ways to interact in a deeper way with the service. A trivia section generates quizzes based on movies customers have viewed. A review section allows users to write and read reviews about movies in Cinemagic's collection. A chat function allows users to interact with other users. Magic picks helps users pick out a movie if they can't decide. Lastly, a rewards section lets members earn rewards for referring new customers. The design of this utilizes a spotlight-like element to display content in order to evoke the feeling of a stage show. Finally, this page has consistent elements with the other two for easy navigation.</p>

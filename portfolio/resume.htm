    <h1>Resume</h1>  
<p> Having spent many years in public service, I am currently transitioning to Web Development. My development experience includes Ruby on Rails, PHP, SQL(SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) HTML5, CSS(SASS, Bootstrap) and JavaScript(JQuery). I also have experience with Git revision control and Unix/Linux commands. During my time in public service, I assisted people with the use of the Web and noted the myriad of troubles they experienced. I am eager to apply that feedback to creating the best Web experiences possible. </p>
